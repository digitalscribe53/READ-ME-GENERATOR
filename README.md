# Professional README Generator

## Description

The Professional README Generator is an application that runs in the command line by asking the user some questions about the project and returns a completed README.md file. It was created with JavaScript and is run from the command line with node.js. Some starter code existed for this project, consisting of function names and TODO comments describing functions within the generateMarkdown.js and index.js files. 

## Installation

The application requires the installation of the npm inquirer package to accept and store user inputs from the command line questions. After cloning the existing repo files, the command 'npm install inquirer' will fetch and install the latest version of inquirer. To install a specific version, the command 'npm install inquirer@8.2.4' can be used, where the version number is 8.2.4. 

## Usage 

Once the package and node modules installation are completed, the application can be run by entering 'node index.js' in the terminal. Several questions will prompt the user for responses about the project. Once all questions are answered, a professional README.md file is created in the current directory.
